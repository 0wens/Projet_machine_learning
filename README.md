# Projet_machine_learning
In this repository we have 3 csv files which are datasets and 2 pyhton files which are the execution.
We want to predict the weight of someone with linear regression.

## Python
Python is used to import data, clean it, and build a model with cleaned dataset.

  ### Import
  Import csv files with all data
  
  ### Cleaning
  Keep only interesting columns and regularize values(replace null or wrong values)
  
  ### Building
  Use the cleaned data and try to find a model with regression
